Project Description
  We will build Tetris using logic design concepts (Hardware threads, 18-240 
    Lab 3b) on an Altera FPGA, using a Terasic DE2-115 board.
  There will be no software in our solution.
  We will investigate using different FPGA tools and boards than are currently 
    used in 18-240 or 18-545. We will use the Altera DE2-115 board and the 
    Altera Quartis toolset.
  Input will be from a keyboard or controller. Output will be to a VGA monitor.
